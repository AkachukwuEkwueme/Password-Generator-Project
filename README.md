# Password-Generator-Project
This is a random password generator designed for an app but can be used for general device password purposes also. 

This project was done in hopes of improving Java skills and getting something fun and creative done, with useful functionality for a future innovative idea (an application). The functionality of the password generator is to firstly inform the user of the rules and functions of the program, then asks user for inputs (on criteria they can use for the generation of the password being  alphabets, numbers, and symbols) and then asking for an input for the password length, the program then generates a random password with the input length and given criteria and finally checks the strength of the password then assigns a score. 

The program hashes out warnings and loops again if the user inputs are not valid for the three given criteria's, as well as the password length, giving users opportunity to try another input.
